**Author**: Seth Pierce
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
This application allows users to search for cities and it displays the city's name, latitude, longititude, and a map of the city.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
The user must create a react app, install axios, install react-bootstrap, and have their own LocationIQ access key to be able to get started to build the app.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

I am using Javascript, React, React-bootstrap, Axios, and CSS to build this application.
